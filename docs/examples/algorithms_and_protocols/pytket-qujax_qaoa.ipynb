It consists of a unitary $U(\\beta, \\gamma)$ formed by alternate repetitions of $U(\\beta)=e^{-i\\beta H_B}$ and $U(\\gamma)=e^{-i\\gamma H_P}$, where $H_B$ is the mixing Hamiltonian and $H_P$ the problem Hamiltonian. The goal is to find the optimal parameters that minimize $H_P$.\n","Given a depth $d$, the expression of the final unitary is $U(\\beta, \\gamma) = U(\\beta_d)U(\\gamma_d)\\cdots U(\\beta_1)U(\\gamma_1)$.
