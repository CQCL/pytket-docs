As programmers usually write logical quantum circuits with no sense of architecture (or may want to run their circuit on a range of hardware with different connectivity constraints), most quantum software development kits offer the means to automatically solve this constraint. One common way is to automatically add logical ```SWAP``` gates to a Circuit, changing the position of logical qubits on physical qubits until a two-qubit gate can be realised. This is an active area of research in quantum computing and a problem we discuss in our paper \"On The Qubit Routing Problem\" - arXiv:1902.08091."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In TKET this constraint is represented by the ```Architecture``` class.
