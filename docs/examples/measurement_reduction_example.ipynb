Naively, one would obtain the expectation value of each of these smaller operators individually by doing shots on the quantum computer and measuring in the correct Pauli bases. Assuming the device measures only single qubits in the $Z$-basis, this basis change requires single-qubit Clifford gates, which are \"cheaper\" (less noisy and quicker) than entangling gates. The sum of these smaller operator expectation values is then used to obtain the desired $\\langle \\psi \\vert H \\vert \\psi \\rangle$.<br>\n", "<br>\n", "However, the scaling of this process can be poor, meaning that many shots are required. Instead, several of these smaller operators can be measured simultaneously, reducing the total number of measurements.
