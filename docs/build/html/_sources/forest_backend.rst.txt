=============

```pytket`` <https://cqcl.github.io/pytket>`__ is a Python module for
interfacing with CQC t|ket>, a set of quantum programming tools.

generating programs in the Quil language and running them on the Forest
platform.

``pytket_pyquil`` is an extension to ``pytket`` that allows ``pytket``
circuits to be run on Rigetti backends and simulators, as well as
conversion to and from pyQuil representations.
