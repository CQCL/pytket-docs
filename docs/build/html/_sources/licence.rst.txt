SOFTWARE LICENCE AGREEMENT

This Software Licence Agreement (the "Licence") is a legal agreement between
you, the end-user, and Cambridge Quantum Computing Limited ("CQC"). By
downloading, accessing, copying or using the pytket python module (version
0.7.1) in source or compiled form, with or without any sub-packages in source or
compiled form (collectively, the "Software"), you are agreeing to be bound by
the terms of this Licence, which permits both commercial and non-commercial use
of the Software. If you do not agree to the terms of this Licence, do not
download, access, copy or use the Software.

SOFTWARE LICENCE

Grant of Licence:

In consideration of your agreement to abide by the terms of this Licence, CQC
grants to you a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable,
gratuity-free, worldwide right to use the Software for both commercial and
non-commercial purposes. You have no ownership or proprietary rights in or to
the Software.

You may install and use the Software only in accordance with the terms of this
Licence.

The Software, together with any copies thereof (including any archive copies),
shall be destroyed by you when use is no longer in accordance with this Licence,
or, when the right to use the Software is otherwise terminated.

Prohibited Uses:

You must not copy the Software except where such copying is incidental to normal
licensed use of the Software or where it is strictly necessary for the purpose
of back-up or operational security.

You are not permitted (nor may you direct anyone else on your behalf), under any
circumstances, and never for money or other consideration, to, amongst other
things, rent, sell, lease, offer for sale, distribute, redistribute, copy,
disclose or use, the Software itself or any part thereof.

You shall not disassemble, de-compile, reverse engineer, attempt to discover any
source code.

You agree to comply with all applicable technology control or export laws and
regulations.

Feedback:

To the extent you provide CQC any suggestions, recommendations, data or feedback
in connection with this Licence ("Feedback"), you agree that CQC may store and
use such Feedback free of payment for any purpose.

Intellectual Property Rights:

You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights, including copyrights, in
the Software throughout the world belong to CQC, that rights in the Software are
licensed (not sold) to you, and that you do not have now or in the future any
intellectual property rights in, or to, the Software other than the right to use
the Software strictly in accordance with the terms of this Licence.

You acknowledge that you have no right to have access to the Software in source
code form other than as provided as accessible in the Software itself, as the
case may be, and as permitted in this Licence.

Certain parts of the source code of the Software in compiled form may be derived
from third party open source software, which you may be licensed to use
independently under the associated open source licence. A list of those parts
and the applicable licences and attributions are provided at
https://cqcl.github.io/pytket/build/html/opensource.html.

You agree to use your best efforts to ensure that any user of the Software
licensed hereunder complies with this Licence.

This Licence does not give you any rights to use any registered or unregistered
trademarks of CQC, nor does this Licence give you any rights to any registered
or unregistered intellectual property rights of CQC which are not related to the
Software or its use.

NO WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR INDEMNITIES

This Software is provided on an AS IS basis. You acknowledge that the Software
is still under development by CQC and that it is experimental and that, to the
fullest extent of the law, all warranties, guarantees or indemnities are
excluded, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability,
accuracy, completeness, quality and fitness for a particular purpose. You
acknowledge that the Software has not been developed to meet your individual
requirements and that CQC does not represent or warrant that the use of the
Software will be uninterrupted or error-free. In respect of these exclusions,
you may have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

To the maximum extent permitted by law, CQC will not be liable to you under any
legal theory (including any contract, negligence or tort theory) for any losses
or damages which may be suffered by you directly or indirectly. By way of
example, CQC shall have no liability for special damage, incidental damage,
consequential damage, loss of profits, loss of anticipated savings, loss of
business opportunity, loss of goodwill, or loss or corruption of data. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories of
damage, so part or all of the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you
in your jurisdiction.

YOUR REPRESENTATION AND INDEMNITY

You represent and warrant that your use of the Software will not be unlawful or
illegal and you agree that any use with third party software or services will
comply with the requirements of that third party. You agree to indemnify and
hold harmless CQC and its affiliates against any claims, suits, actions,
liabilities, losses, costs or damage suffered by CQC and any of its affiliates
now and in the future as a result of your use of the Software in breach of the
terms of this Licence.

Termination:

Breach of any of the terms of this Licence shall be considered a material breach
and shall cause it to automatically terminate without notice.

CQC retains the right to terminate this Licence at its sole discretion at any
time, without notice, and with or without cause.

Governing Law and Jurisdiction:

This Licence shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of
England and Wales and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English
courts for any disputes regarding it. Copyright and other proprietary matters
will be governed by the relevant applicable national laws and international
treaties.

Miscellaneous:

This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between you and CQC with regard to
its subject matter.

If you are using the Software on behalf of an entity, whether a company,
academic institution or other organisation, you are agreeing to this Licence on
behalf of such entity and you represent and warrant that you are legally
entitled to do so, and references to ‘you’ in this Licence shall be construed
accordingly, and to include any person using the Software on behalf of such
entity.

This Licence does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of
Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Licence.

If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do
under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your
breach of this contract, you agree that it will not mean that you do not have to
do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you and, at our
discretion, any such company, academic institution or other organisation you are
acting on behalf of, at a later date.

Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or
relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining
paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.

No variation to this Licence shall be valid and effective unless made in writing
and signed by all parties.
