pytket-qiskit
=============

```pytket`` <https://cqcl.github.io/pytket>`__ is a Python module for
interfacing with CQC t|ket>, a set of quantum programming tools.

IBM's `Qiskit <https://qiskit.org>`__ is an open-source framework for
quantum computation, ranging from high-level algorithms to low-level
circuit representations, simulation and access to the `IBM Q
Experience <https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/>`__ devices.

``pytket_qiskit`` is an extension to ``pytket`` that allows ``pytket``
circuits to be run on IBM backends and simulators, as well as conversion
to and from Qiskit representations.

Getting started
---------------

``pytket_qiskit`` is available for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, on Linux and
MacOS. To install, run:

``pip install pytket_qiskit``
