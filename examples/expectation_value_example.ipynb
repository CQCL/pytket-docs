    "Given a circuit generating a quantum state $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$, it is very common to have an operator $H$ and ask for the expectation value $\\langle \\psi \\vert H \\vert \\psi \\rangle$. A notable example is in quantum computational chemistry, where $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$ encodes the wavefunction for the electronic state of a small molecule, and the energy of the molecule can be derived from the expectation value with respect to the molecule's Hamiltonian operator $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses this chemistry scenario to demonstrate the overall procedure for using `pytket` to perform advanced high-level procedures. We build on top of topics covered by several other example notebooks, including circuit generation, optimisation, and using different backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is limited built-in functionality in `pytket` for obtaining expectation values from circuits. This is designed to encourage users to consider their needs for parallelising the processing of circuits, manipulating results (e.g. filtering, adjusting counts to mitigate errors, and other forms of data processing), or more advanced schemes for grouping the terms of the operator into measurement circuits. For this example, suppose that we want to focus on reducing the queueing time for IBM device backends, and filter our shots to eliminate some detected errors.\n",

    "This notebook makes use of the Qiskit and ProjectQ backend modules `pytket_qiskit` and `pytket_projectq`, which should first be installed via `pip`.\n",

    "We will start by generating an ansatz and Hamiltonian for the chemical of interest. Here, we are just using a simple model of $\\mathrm{H}_2$ with four qubits representing the occupation of four spin orbitals."
