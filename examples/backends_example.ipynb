    "This example shows how to use pytket to export quantum circuits to the various allowed backends. As t|ket> is designed to be platform agnostic, any t|ket> circuit can be run using any instance of the `Backend` class for maximum portability. The circuit will be optimised, rebased and routed for the appropriate backend automatically - although this feature can be switched off. We currently provide an interface to a variety of simulators and any IBM quantum experience chip that the user has access to, and this interface uses a common structure so it is easy to switch between backends. The full list at the time of writing is:\n",
