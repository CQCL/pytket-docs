To view the graphs, you will need an intallation of `plotly-orca`.\n","\n","Current quantum hardware fits into the NISQ (Noisy, Intermediate-Scale Quantum) regime. This noise cannot realistically be combatted using conventional error correcting codes, because of the lack of available qubits, noise levels exceeding the code thresholds, and very few devices available that can perform measurements and corrections mid-circuit. Analysis of how quantum algorithms perform under noisy conditions is a very active research area, as is finding ways to cope with it. Here, we will look at how well we can perform the Entanglement Swapping protocol with different noise levels.\n","\n","The Entanglement Swapping protocol requires two parties to share Bell pairs with a third party, who applies the Qubit Teleportation protocol to generate a Bell pair between the two parties. The Qubit Teleportation step requires us to be able to measure some qubits and make subsequent corrections to the remaining qubits. There are only a handful of simulators and devices that currently support this, with others restricted to only measuring the qubits at the end of the circuit.\n","\n","The most popular circuit model with conditional gates at the moment is that provided by the OpenQASM language. This permits a very restricted model of classical logic, where we can apply a gate conditionally on the exact value of a classical register.
