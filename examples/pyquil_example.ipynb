    "Rigetti's pyQuil package provides a clear and well-documented syntax for circuit construction, along with access to the Quil compiler, QVM simulator, and Quantum Cloud Services for access to real hardware devices. It is also the standard output for circuits from Grove.\n",

    "t|ket> provides users with the luxury of choice for the combination of front-end (high-level algorithms and circuit construction) and back-end (device/simulator). This tutorial will demonstrate this by taking a pyQuil program generated by Grove and running it on Qiskit's Aer simulator, applying some optimisations in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run everything in this notebook you will need `pytket`, `pytket_pyquil` and `pytket_qiskit` installed using pip. E.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pytket\n",
    "pip install pytket_pyquil\n",
    "pip install pytket_qiskit\n",

    "Grove provides a nifty tool for arbitrary state generation - given a desired state, it constructs a circuit which maps the ground state to this target. However, it is not immediately obvious how this would act on other initial states. Qiskit's Aer provides a unitary simulator, giving the full unitary matrix for a given circuit which would be useful for this. We will use pytket as an intermediate step to connect the two together.\n",
